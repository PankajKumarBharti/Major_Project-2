# Major_Project-2 :  Building a 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Predicting 
Viral Pneumonia in CT Scans
## Object
- Develop a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting viral pneumonia from chest CT scans.
- Optimize the architecture and hyper parameters of the 3D CNN to improve accuracy and performance.
- Apply data augmentation and preprocessing techniques to enhance the training dataset and model generalization.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a test dataset.


## METHODOLOGY
## ðŸ“Œ Project Steps

- **Understanding the Problem:**
  - Research pneumonia and its impact.
  - Study how CT scans are used for diagnosis.

- **Collecting the Dataset:**
  - Obtain a publicly available CT scan dataset.
  - Ensure the dataset has labeled images for training and testing.

- **CLAHE:**
  - CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) is a computer vision technique used to improve the contrast of an image while avoiding excessive noise amplification.

- **Baseline U-Net:**
  - A foundational deep learning architecture for image segmentation, designed to assign a label to each pixel, segmenting the image into meaningful parts.

- **Designing the Model:**
  - Build a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) architecture.
  - Include layers for feature extraction and classification.

- **Training the Model:**
  - Train the 3D CNN using the training dataset.
